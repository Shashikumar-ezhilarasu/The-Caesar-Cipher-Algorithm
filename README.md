**Caesar Cipher Python Project**
*Overview*
The Caesar Cipher Java Project is a simple implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm. This program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specified number of positions. The project is written in Java and is intended to provide a basic understanding of how substitution ciphers work.

How It Works:
Encrypt Function: The encrypt function shifts each letter in the input text by the given shift amount. If the character is not a letter, it is left unchanged.

Decrypt Function: The decrypt function shifts the text back by the negative of the shift amount, effectively reversing the encryption.

GUI Components:

Input Text: A text box where you can enter the plain text to encrypt or the cipher text to decrypt.
Shift Entry: An entry field where you specify the shift amount.
Encrypt Button: Encrypts the text in the input text box and displays the result in the output text box.
Decrypt Button: Decrypts the text in the input text box and displays the result in the output text box.
Output Text: A text box where the result (encrypted or decrypted text) is displayed.
Running the Code:
Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., caesar_cipher_gui.py).
Run the file using Python: python caesar_cipher_gui.py.
A window will open where you can enter text, specify a shift value, and click buttons to encrypt or decrypt the text.
This GUI provides a simple way to interact with the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher.
